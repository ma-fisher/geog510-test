Food security is a pressing concern worldwide. Mycotoxin contamination, 
caused by fungi that thrive in challenging environments, poses a serious 
threat to crop yields and nutritional quality. These toxins can linger 
even after harvest, impacting our ability to secure food supplies for 
communities globally.  Adding to the complexity of this issue is climate 
change, which exacerbates fungal growth and increases the likelihood of 
mycotoxin formation.  Addressing both challenges requires innovative 
solutions and collaborative efforts to ensure food security for all.
